# Mellow Engine
Mellow Engine is a game engine that I'm working on. While not the 
first I've ever made, it will definitely be the most organized and 
cohesive.

# Platforms
Mellow Engine currently only supports Windows, but its design will 
allow me to more easily implement other platforms later on.

It uses OpenGL and I plan on adding support for DirectX and Vulkan 
in the future.

# Installation with GIT
This installation method is pretty simple. Essentially, all you 
need to do is run this command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SandyFalafel/Mellow [YOUR_DIRECTORY]
```

The --recursive flag is necessary because it downloads all 
submodules as well. Without these, the engine will not work.
